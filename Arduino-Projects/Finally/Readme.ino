      Physical keys are the most natural way to lock oropen a door, and everyone is familiar with it.
   Although the physical key is a well-proven and well-known technology, it isnot without faults. For a lock,
   there can only be one unique key.Different keys are required for various locks.Carrying a big number of keys
   is also inconvenient. Smart locks are key-less door locks that let you unlock your door without having to use a real key.
   A smart lock is an electromagnetically lock that is meant to unlock a door after checking the Identity of the person.
